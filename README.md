## What is EDA?

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a key part of the data science process that involves diving into a dataset to explore and understand it better. 
The main goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data before moving on to things like building machine learning models or running statistical tests. 
It helps us:

- Spot any anomalies, missing values, or outliers that could impact analysis.
- Discover underlying trends and structures in the data.
- Refine our initial assumptions and ask more focused questions.
- Visualize how different variables relate to each other and how data is distributed.

## Why is EDA Important in Data Science?

In the bigger picture of **data science**, EDA is one of the most essential steps. It allows data scientists to:

- **Ask better questions**: By exploring the data thoroughly, we can frame more accurate and insightful questions for analysis.
- **Get the data ready for modeling**: EDA helps clean and transform the data into the right format for running machine learning models.
- **Boost model performance**: By identifying which features (variables) are most important and understanding correlations, EDA helps improve how well a model can make predictions.
- **Present insights clearly**: EDA makes it easier to explain findings through charts, graphs, and summaries, helping to communicate insights to both technical teams and non-technical stakeholders.
